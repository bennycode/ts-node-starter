# ts-node-starter

The `ts-node-starter` scaffolding project is a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) which makes it easy for you to start a new Node.js project with TypeScript.

Using this template, you can build **standalone apps**, **libraries** and/or **CLI tools**. The `ts-node-starter` setup is configurable and comes with a lot of features included.

## Usage

### Make it your own

1. Replace all occurrences of "bennycode" with your own username (or organization name)
2. Replace all occurrences of "ts-node-starter" with your project name (or repository name)
3. Start writing your code in the ["src" directory](./src)
4. Run `npm install` and be happy! ðŸ˜Š

### Build a standalone app

**Source Code**

If you just want to write and run a Node.js app, checkout ["src/start.ts"](./src/start.ts).

**References**

You can start your application by executing `yarn start`. If you want to debug your code, run `yarn debug` ([Debug Instructions](https://dev.to/typescripttv/debug-your-node-js-app-with-chrome-devtools-4c98)).

### Build a Library

**Source Code**

If you want to distribute your code as a Node.js library on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), you can have a look at ["src/index.ts"](./src/index.ts). If you build a library, I recommend to always ship an index file from where you export the code of your library for others.

**References**

In the ["package.json" file](./package.json) you will also discover a "main" property which defines the entry point to your library when it gets imported by other developers. The value of the "main" property has to point to the transpiled JavaScript code.

### Build a CLI

**Source Code**

If you want to build a CLI tool for Node.js, you can have a look at ["src/cli.ts"](./src/cli.ts).

**References**

In the ["package.json" file](./package.json) you will also discover a "bin" property which defines the executable name of your tool and the entry point to its transpiled JavaScript code.

If you don't want to publish a CLI, simply remove the "bin" property and the CLI script.

## Conventions

### Test Files

I recommend to colocate your test code with your source code by naming your test files `*.test.ts`.

### Changelog Generation

The automatic changelog generation is based on [Semantic Commit Messages](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages). Simply use the suggested prefixes in your commit messages to make use of it. For example, if you commit a new feature use the "feat" prefix:

**Commit Message**

> feat: My new feature

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with the Git pre-commit hook, then reinstall the hook using the following command:

```bash
npx lefthook install -a
```
